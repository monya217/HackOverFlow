PROBLEM STATEMENT (FINTECH- 8.Improve Credit Scoring):

Conventional credit scoring methods like credit history, collateral, or any prior accounts might not give every person an equal opportunity to establish credit. As a result, a small number of people can access basic banking services like opening a bank account and acquiring a loan. Using the pre-existing datasets, we can understand the track record of banks and the reason why conventional credit scoring is needed. Come up with an AI based solution to perform credit scoring for people who don’t have any previous loans. This can be done by checking some other billing cycles they’ve been a part of and creating a scoring metrics on the basis of that.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project is mainly focused on the population which is deprived of the basic banking services which include availing loans without having a credit score. 

We have come up with an AI solution where we are provided with data about historic customer behavior. Hence when we acquire new customers with no previous loan history, it can predict who is riskier and who is not.

We have used a basic Logistic Regression model to find the required solution to the given problem. We imported the dataset from kaggle.com and tried out various correlations, attribute combinations to analyze and understand the data. Once the raw data was completely cleaned and freed of redundancies we used it in the ML algorithm to buld the solution - credit scorecard.

DATASET USED:

To build our project, we decided to use datasets available on kaggle.com
