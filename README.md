# HackOverFlow
This project is mainly focused on the population which is deprived of the basic banking services which include availing loans without having a credit score. 

We have come up with an AI solution where we are provided with data about historic customer behavior. Hence when we acquire new customers with no previous loan history, it can predict who is riskier and who is not.

We have used a basic Logistic Regression model to find the required solution to the given problem. We imported the dataset from kaggle.com and tried out various correlations, attribute combinations to analyze and understand the data. Once the raw data was completely cleaned and freed of redundancies we used it in the ML algorithm to buld the solution - credit scorecard.

To build our project, we decided to use datasets available on kaggle.com
